            <p>
                Elijah gets threatened by Queen Jezebel and he becomes afraid and runs away. God sends an Angel to provide Elijah with physical needs and restores his strength. Even in the darkest moments of our lives, we should hold onto faith that God is in control and is sending His Angels to uplift us.

            <p>
                Jesus says He is the bread from heaven. We should take caution on what we feed our body, mind, and soul. If we feed on negativity and distractions, our lives lack purpose and growth. If I eat and drink the word of God, then I am able to experience life to the fullest, experience growth, and have purpose in my life.

        <h2>Ephesians 4:30</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The believer is the one who is sealed by the Holy Spirit. "Lord, forgive me for not honoring you with my words and actions. Lord, forgive me for not acknowledging your presence within me. Forgive me for grieving you and the Holy Spirit. You have blessed me with the gift of life; the breath in me is the most intimate thing in my life. I don't take such a gift for granted. I am grateful for it."
